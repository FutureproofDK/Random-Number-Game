# ðŸŽ¯ Random Number Game

A simple Python terminal game where the player guesses a randomly generated number between 1 and 20.

This project was built as part of my week 2 milestone while learning Python. It demonstrates:

- User input handling
- Loops and conditionals
- Error catching with `try/except`
- Replay logic using `while True`

### ðŸ”§ How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script using:
   
   ```bash
   python3 RandomNumberGame.py
   ```
   
4. Try to guess the secret number.
5. Play again. (Or don't. I'm not your mom.)
This was my first full script. First time coder here. More coming soon!
